## Performance Metrics

The training process was monitored using various metrics. The plots generated from these metrics can be found in the logs directory.

### Training and Validation Loss

This plot shows the training and validation losses over epochs. The steady decrease in both losses indicates effective learning and good generalization to unseen data.

### KL Divergence

The KL divergence plot demonstrates how the model's latent space regularization evolved during training.

## Visual Outputs

The model's performance was also evaluated visually through generated and reconstructed images.

### Generated Images
