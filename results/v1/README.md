## Performance Metrics

Throughout the experiment, the training and validation losses were carefully monitored. Below are the plots generated from these metrics, which can be found in the logs directory as specified in the configuration file.

### Training Loss

![Training Loss Plot](train_losses.png)  
The training loss decreased steadily, indicating that the model was learning effectively over the epochs.

### Validation Loss

![Validation Loss Plot](val_losses.png)  
The validation loss mirrored the training loss, suggesting that the model was generalizing well to unseen data.

### Train vs. Val Loss

![Train vs. Val Loss Plot](loss_comparison.png)  
The train vs. val loss plot shows how the model's loss evolved during training.

### Visual Outputs

The model's ability to generate and reconstruct images was also evaluated. The visual assessment of the model's performance is demonstrated through:

Generated Images: Sample images generated by the model are displayed below.
